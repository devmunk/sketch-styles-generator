## Why this Plugin?
* Sketch doesn't allow to generate **multiple Shared Styles** (text, shapes, or both) at once
* Sketch appends a ` Style` suffix to the name of **every style** you try to create
* Craft and other tools generate guidelines that may not **fit your app styling**

If you experienced at least one of the problems above, you know how painful the bootstrap of a *Design System* can be. The manual creation, renaming and double-check of every Shared Style is a slow process. And time is a precious resource (aka *we got a lot of shit to do*).

**Sketch Styles Generator** allows you to select any amount of layers (text, shapes, or all of them at once), and generate multiple Shared Styles named exactly like the layer itself. Have a look at the [usage](#usage) section to know more about how to use it.

If you need a similar approach to automate the **Symbols** creation, [Batch Create Symbols](https://github.com/demersdesigns/sketch-batch-create-symbols) released by [Paul Demers](https://twitter.com/demersdesigns) is what you're looking for.

## Installation
#### Manual
* [Download](https://github.com/lucaorio/sketch-styles-generator/releases/latest) the latest release of the plugin [`sketch-styles-generator.zip`](https://github.com/lucaorio/sketch-styles-generator/releases/latest)
* Uncompress the downloaded file
* Double-click `Sketch Styles Generator.sketchplugin` to install it

#### Via Sketch Runner
* Trigger [Sketch Runner](http://bit.ly/SketchRunnerWebsite) (`cmd+'`)
* Move to the *Install* tab
* Search for *Styles Generator* and install it

## Usage
* **Rename** the layers you want to generate your Shared Styles from. The speed of this boring process can be *dramatically* improved by using plugins like [Find-And-Replace](https://github.com/mscodemonkey/Sketch-Find-And-Replace) and [RenameIt](https://github.com/rodi01/RenameIt).
* **Select** all of them, it doesn't matter if they are Shape or Text entities
* **Run** the plugin by clicking `Plugins->Styles Generator->Generate Shared Styles`, or by using the `ctrl+cmd+s` shortcut
* A little log on the bottom of the window will show you how many Styles were generated, and how many were updated.

## FAQ
#### What happens if in my multiple selection there are some Symbols/Groups?
Sketch Styles Generator will detect the kind of layer you selected, and automatically skip Symbols and other entities that can't be converted into a Text/Shared Style.

## Integrations
*Sketch Styles Generator* is now fully integrated with [Sketch Runner](http://bit.ly/SketchRunnerWebsite), the ultimate tool to speed up your Sketch workflow. You can trigger the plugin by simply typing its first letters, in pure Spotlight style!
